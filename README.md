- Many companies are creating great value for their customers but are often not able to capture that value. While they compete on superior customer value, they lose business on price or sell too low. What they need is to move from cost-based pricing to value-based pricing. Hello, I am Stefan Michel, Professor of Marketing and Service Management and Dean of the Executive MBA program at IMD International Business School in Switzerland. In this course, I show you the strategies and tactics of value-based pricing and also how pricing psychology can help you to charge the price you deserve. Value-based pricing is relevant for any firm regardless of size or industry. Whether you are an executive in a large firm, a business owner, or a freelancer, join me and make your business more profitable.




Charge what you deserve

- Every business has to make pricing decisions. Whether you are a freelance photographer, a pharmaceutical company or Boeing, selling airplanes. Empirical research shows that too many executives and entrepreneurs use cost-based pricing, which means that they calculate their production cost and add a markup. For example, 100% to set the price. Let's take a restaurant as an example because you all know restaurants and maybe wonder how they price but also because I grew up in my parents' restaurant. I literally spent my childhood with my siblings at table 11. If you break down the total expenses for restaurant, you see that about 33.3% are direct costs for food and beverage, 61.6% are indirect costs, and 5% is the net profit margin. Based on these numbers, cost-based pricing would suggest that you take the cost of your food and beverage and triple it to define the price. Because three times 33.3% are very close to 100%. With this, you ensure that you don't spend more than 33% on direct costs. And with the rest, you can cover your indirect costs and secure a 5% margin. However, if my father did that, he will charge $24 for a hamburger and $4.50 for a glass of wine since the costs are $8 and $1.5 respectively. Clearly, that price would be too high for the hamburgers and too low for the wine, at least for most guests. My father learned from experience that guests are willing to pay $18 for a hamburger and $7 for a glass of wine. As you can see, the markup for wine is much higher than for hamburgers. This looks either unethical, unfair, or illegal. It's none of the above. The reason my father does not use cost-based pricing is that customers are willing to pay a higher markup for wine than for food. If he would charge $24 for a hamburger and $4.50 for a wine, he would probably lose his loyal guests, which would destroy his business. The keyword I mentioned above is willingness to pay, which depends on the value perceived. In other words, the more I value your product or service, the more I'm willing to pay. You can charge me less than I'm willing to pay, thank you, amigo, we still have a deal. But if you charge me more, I'm not buying. Let me take another example. Switzerland, where I'm from, is famous for its watches. Some people buy a Swatch for 50 francs, it tells them the time. Some buy an Omega for 5,000 francs, it tells them the time. Some buy a Rolex for 15,000 francs, it tells them the time. And some buy a Breguet for 180,000 francs. For that money, you can hire two people walking behind you to tell you the time. What this illustrates is that willingness to pay for a watch is very individual. And this applies to any other category.

Improve your profitability with pricing

- Let's start with requests. What if a graphic designer increases the hourly rate by 10% and as a result she loses 10% of her work? Do you think her profitability is increasing or decreasing? Let's have a look. Her income statement may look like this. She bills 1,200 hours per year for her own work and 3,000 hours for all freelancers that she employs over the year. Her costs are $90,000, which leaves her a gross profit of $120,000. Now, she increases the price by 10% and gets 10% less work. Her revenue declines by 1% but her profit increases by $11,400, which is 9.5%. How is that even possible? The reason for this leverage is called variable costs. Her revenue declines by $3,600 but the money she pays to the freelancers decreases by $15,000. Hence her profit increases by $11,400. And we can assume she has a better life since she works 10% less. Who doesn't want that? While we are at it, we can challenge the assumption that she will actually lose 10% of her clients. Short-term, this might be the consequence of a price increase. However, she has now more time to search for better clients, to improve the quality of her work, and ultimately win new clients who are willing to pay a bit more. So here comes the second question. What do you think would be the profit impact if she can increase the price by 10% without losing clients? Would it be more or less than 10%? As my calculation shows, her revenue would increase by 10%. This is not surprising given that we just increased the price by 10%. I love it when it makes too much sense. 10% of 360,000 is 36,000 more in revenue. Since the costs don't increase, this additional revenue goes directly to the bottom line. Hence her gross profit increases from 120,000 to 156,000, which is an increase of 30%. In short, a price increase of 10% results in a profit increase of 30%. Now, you look at this and you might think, "It cannot be that easy to increase profitability." But in my experience, improving your pricing is the best way to increase profitability. And it increases your brand perception, your reputation, and also the quality of your clients. I would like to show you a shortcut for how to estimate the profit leverage. It's called contribution margin. In the case of the graphic designer, she charges $80 per hour for a freelancer and pays them $50. So she makes $30 contribution margin per hour on every freelancer. For this money, she needs to win the client, coordinating the work, listen to all complaints both from the clients and the freelancer. So it's harder money. When she now increases the price by 10% the contribution margin does not increase by 10% but by 26.66%. So as a rule of thumb, when thinking about pricing make sure that you don't focus on revenues but on the contribution margin that you can generate to cover your fixed costs and achieve a higher profit.
